Nightbot Giveaways can be used a variety of different ways. This page is to simply inform about the different giveaways that can be used in your stream.

## The Basics

Upon entering the [Giveaways](https://beta.nightbot.tv/giveaways) page you are presented with an Eligibility List, a Giveaway Panel and a chat window.

### Eligibility List

The Eligibility List is to show the current pool of users to win the current giveaway as well as search through the list. 

A user has a blue circle/dot mark eligible mark next to their name means they are eligible to win the current giveaway. When they chat or enter, they are automatically given the blue circle mark. Clicking the mark next to a user will toggle their eligibility.

Next to the Search Bar is a Reset Eligibility Button which will clear the eligibility of all users in the list. 

### Giveaway Panel

At the top of the giveaway panel is the ability to filter out different user groups. These can be selected and deselected at any time.

#### Giveaway Types

Nightbot currently offers three different types of giveaways to choose from.

- *Active User* - Will select a user in the eligibility list that has chatted in the defined time length.

- *Keyword* - Allows users to enter by entering a set keyword. Anti Spam options to make users ineligible after already saying the keyword. *Note: * Changing Keywords will reset all users eligibility.

- *Random Number* - Will generate a random number between two picked numbers. The first user to say the number generated is the winner.

#### Extra Luck

Subscribers and Regulars can be selected to have more entries using the luck sliders. Simply adjust the sliders respectively to the desired amount.

### Winners!

Once a user has won any giveaway their profile image will be displayed with options to visit their Twitch page and a link to send a Twitch Direct Message. The Giveaway Panel is replaced with their chat and a timer to mark inactivity.
