Thats right! Nightbot is now available on Discord. This a quick guide of how to setup Nightbot for Discord.

No idea what Discord is? Discord is an all-in-one voice and text chat for gamers thatâ€™s free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone. Check them out at [discordapp.com](https://discordapp.com/)!

### Set-up

1. In order to have Nightbot in your Discord server, you need a Discord Server. If you haven't already, head over to [discordapp.com](https://discordapp.com/) and make yourself a profile and create a server. More information about Discord can be found on their [help pages](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us).

2. Sign into Nightbot and head to the [Integrations](https://beta.nightbot.tv/integrations) tab. Here all integrations settings for Discord are managed.

3. Clicking "Connect" will open a popup where you allow Nightbot to access your Discord. Upon granting access you'll then be able to add a Discord server for Nightbot to join. Select a server from the dropdown list and click "Authorize".

4. Nightbot should now be in your Discord Server! Nightbot is also given a Discord created role named "Nightbot". (try assigning him a color) All of your Nightbot commands will now be functional in your Discord.

5. Click the newly available "settings" button. For each userlevel, select the appropriate user role for Moderators, Regulars, and Subscribers, if applicable. We understand Discord as a built-in integration to sync subscribers, this is merely to let Nightbot identify subscribers. Enabling "Role Syncing" will auto-sync these roles every 15 minutes. Click "Update" to save these settings. **Note:** In order to sync, users must be connected through their account in the Integrations Tab in the Discord User Settings.

6. Optionally, enabling "Spam Filtering" will allow Nightbot to delete messages of offending users. This will respect Nightbot spam filters and userlevels previously set. This feature is disabled by default and should only enabled you're okay with Nightbot deleting user messages. Because there is no timeout function in Discord yet, Nightbot will only delete that users message.
