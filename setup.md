## General Setup Guide for Nightbot

This page's purpose is a general guide for new users who want to use Nightbot. This guide will review some of the basics of using Nightbot with more advanced usage on the individual doc site pages. Nightbot is currently available for both Twitch and Youtube Gaming!

This new version of Nightbot has been vastly improved with an easier design, faster response time, and better stability. New features range from running song request from [Spotify](https://docs.nightbot.tv/app-beta) to more [Custom Variables](https://docs.nightbot.tv/commands/variables) to customize your commands and much more.

Welcome to the new and improved Nightbot!

### Sign in & Dashboard

To begin start by heading to the [Nightbot Homepage](https://beta.nightbot.tv/) and sign in using the service you intend to use Nightbot with. Upon granting access you will directed to the Nightbot Control Panel.

The Nightbot Control Panel is the central hub to controlling Nightbot. The Dashboard is a useful area to display stats such as chat activity, command usage, and spam filters in realtime. Using the navigation bar on the left you can edit a specific area of Nightbot.

### Make Nightbot Join Your Channel

On the Dashboard, click the Join Button on the top-right of the page to have Nightbot join your channel. You will then have a popout with instructions for making Nightbot a moderator in your channel. 

**For Youtube:** Nightbot for YouTube will only join your channel when you are live. This is currently a limitation on YouTube due to rate limits on YouTube's API.

### Using and Adding Custom Commands

After adding Nightbot into your chat you can now begin with creating custom commands! Custom commands are an important part of any stream, making information easier to access. You can create commands in the [Custom Command](https://beta.nightbot.tv/commands/custom) page in the Nightbot Control Panel.

Using the Add Command button you can give your commands a name (usually leading with a explanation mark) and a response that Nightbot will return. Check out the [Custom Variables](https://docs.nightbot.tv/commands/variables) page to customize your commands with features like Click-To-Tweet links or displaying the weather of a location.

This can also be done by you or your moderators in the chat. For more information about adding commands in chat check out the [!commands](https://docs.nightbot.tv/commands/commands) page.

### Timers

On the [Timers](https://beta.nightbot.tv/timers) page you can find access to timers that you can configure to have Nightbot display a message every so often. Please be mindful of users when creating timers as repeating messages. The time interval of timers and chat lines required can be changed to your liking and you can enable and disable them as needed. 

### Add Regulars

Regulars are those users that you feel are above the new users. You may want regulars to be ignored when dealing with Spam Filters or you might want your regulars to have access to certain commands. This can be done with ease.

The solution is for you to add users as Regulars into Nightbot. Users can be managed in the [Regulars](https://beta.nightbot.tv/regulars) page, just click the Add User button and enter the Username. Those users are now defined as a regular of the channel and you can filter separate user specific commands around them.

This can also be done by you or your moderators in the chat! For more information about adding regulars in chat check out the [regulars](https://docs.nightbot.tv/commands/regulars) command page.

### Song Request

Song Request is giving the ability for the music in your stream to go into viewers hands. There have been many new and different features added into the Nightbot Song Request including the ability to request songs using search terms!

You can now have access to play your personal playlist if your queue happens to run out of requests. You also have ability to use Monstercat songs if your playlist isn't as good as you wish it was. Also added to Song Request is the ability to use Spotify for playing your music. For more information on how to add that to your stream check out the [Nightbot Alpha Application](https://docs.nightbot.tv/app-beta).

In addition for adding Spotify, you can also use the traditional YouTube set up. Newly added is the ability to change limits for song request itself. Do you want regulars to be able to request more songs? You can change that setting now with ease. Check out the [AutoDJ](https://beta.nightbot.tv/song_requests) page or for more information check out the [AutoDJ Guide](https://docs.nightbot.tv/control-panel/autodj) for everything Song Request with Nightbot.

### Spam Filters

We don't like users who spam chats. Nightbot is there to fix that by dealing with users that spam; only in the way you want. We offer many filters including Capitalization, Links, Symbols and even a custom Blacklist to prevent users from talking about certain topics. All of these can be edited from within the [Spam Protection](https://beta.nightbot.tv/spam_protection) page within the Nightbot Control Panel.
