The !game command displays the current game and allows you and your moderators to modify it.

## Usage

> !game `[game_name]`

`game_name` is the name of the game that you wish to change to. Leaving this blank will just display the game.

### Example

> !game League of Legends

Will set the game to 'League of Legends'.

> !game

Will show the current game.

**Note:** The default userlevel for the !game command is set to `everyone`. Meaning that everyone in the channel can see the current !game, however, only moderators and owner can modify it.
