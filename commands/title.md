The !title command displays the current title and allows you and your moderators to modify it.

## Usage

> !title `[title_name]`

`title_name` is the title that you wish to change. Leaving this blank will just display current stream title.

### Example

> !title Day 3: Building Again

Will set the stream title to 'Day 3: Building Again'.

> !title

Will show the current stream title.

**Note:** The default userlevel for the !title command is set to `everyone`. Meaning that everyone in the channel can see the current !title, however, only moderators and owner can modify it.
