The !title command displays the current title of the stream and allows you and your moderators to modify it.

## Usage

> !title `title`

`title` is the title you wish to change your stream title to. Only place a title to change the title. Omitting this value displays the current title.

### Examples

> !title

will return "Current Stream Title: Day 2: Building Again"

> !title Day 3: Building Again

will return "The stream title has been updated to: Day 3: Building Again"

**Note:** The default userlevel for the !title command is set to `everyone`. This implies that everyone can check the current title of the stream. Only moderators and higher userlevels can modify the title.
