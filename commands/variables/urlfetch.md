/*
Title: UrlFetch
*/

The urlfetch (formerly customapi) variable calls a remote url to retrieve and display a response. It's useful for building more complex commands that Nightbot does not support.

## Usage

> $(urlfetch `url`)

`url` is a URL that returns a body in *plain text* with less than 400 characters in its response
