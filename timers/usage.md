Nightbot Timers have the ability to send messages on user-specified intervals. Due to the nature of repeating messages, they are frequently used for social media links or general chat notifications.

## Usage

Timers can **only** be created and managed in the [Nightbot Timer](https://nightbot.tv/timers)  menu by broadcasters of that channel.

### Creating a Timer

Creating a Timer for your chat couldn't be any easier.

First head over to the Nightbot Timer menu by using the left side panel or by heading over to [nightbot.tv/timers](https://nightbot.tv/timers).

In the top right corner of the panel, click the blue Add button which will open up a popout menu of settings to give your timer.

#### Settings

- *Name* - This is your timer name. This has no real significance but to give you a quick reference to what your timer does. Ex. Twitter Message

- *Message* - What do you want your timer to say? Be creative as you can use [Custom Variables](https://docs.nightbot.tv/?search=variables) in your messages.

- *Interval* - Move the slider to the desired amount of time before the timer repeats. For example, 15 minute intervals will activate at 2:00, 2:15, 2:30, etc.

- *Chat Lines* - This is the minimum amount of chat lines required to activate the timer. This is useful in slow chats to prevent Nightbot from spamming every few messages. 

**Note**: The timer will first wait the specified amount of time and then check to see if the specified number of chat lines have passed before displaying a message. This can account for timer messages not displaying after passing their interval.

Clicking the Submit button will finalize your timer and you can now see it on the Timer Panel.

### Managing Timers

On the Panel screen you will see a list of all timers you have created. All displaying their current status, timer name, timer message, and action buttons. 

#### Action Buttons

- *Disable/Enable* - The Disable/Enable button can be used to turn off and on your timers. This will change the far left column status after clicking.

- *Edit* - The Edit button will re-open the popout menu to edit current timers. Be sure to hit Submit to save changes otherwise changes will be lost.

- *Delete* - The Delete button will prompt you to erase your timer. Please note the name of the timer to be correct and remember that the timer is permanently removed when deleted.
