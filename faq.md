Here are the most common questions we get asked, all on one page. For additional support for specific items use the [Nightbot Forum](https://community.nightdev.com/c/nightbot) or the [Contact Form](https://www.nightdev.com/contact/) for more private matters.

### Why isn't Nightbot joining, I'm using YouTube Gaming? Why is Nightbot taking a long time to respond on YouTube Gaming?

Nightbot for YouTube Gaming will only join your channel when live and can take a few minutes to join. This limitation is due to rate limits on YouTube's API.

It can take Nightbot up to 2 minutes to receive messages if your chat is slow or inactive. The more active your chat, the sooner Nightbot can read and respond to a command.

Both of these limitations cannot be worked around. If Nightbot still isn't joining your channel, it's either not a moderator or is banned from your channel.

**Note:** Spamming the Join/Part button in the Control Panel will just cancel the join operation and results in longer join times.

### My Playlist was deleted and I can't find it. How do I get it back?

Navigate to the [AutoDJ settings](https://beta.nightbot.tv/song_requests) and under the **General** Header change the **Playlist** setting to **Channel**. Personal playlists can be edited in the [Playlist](https://beta.nightbot.tv/song_requests/playlist) page.

If the above doesn't show your playlist please use the [Contact Form](https://nightdev.com/contact/) as your playlist may not have transfered correctly.

### Why do I get songs in AutoDJ that can't be deleted?

There is another playlist active in the AutoDJ settings. Please refer to the previous question to change this.

### How do I get the current song to display on OBS/XSpilt?

Download and install the [Nightbot Application](https://docs.nightbot.tv/app-beta). Upon running song request, a text file is created with the current song in the `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Nightbot\` location for Windows and in `/Users/USERNAME/Documents/Nightbot/` for OSX. At the current time there is no way to edit the output of the song, this will be added in the future releases.

### This isn't working and it should be. This should be added to Nightbot!
